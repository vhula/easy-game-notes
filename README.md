## The Reasons for Betting

#### *Each time you're betting - ask yourself: WHY BET?*

There are only two major reasons for betting (and one more):

1. *Value* - betting to get called (or raised) by a worse hand.
2. *Bluff* - betting to get a better hand to fold.
3. *Capitalization of Dead Money (DM)* - making the opponent to fold, whether
his hand better or worse, and collecting money in the pot.

    * Make him fold his equity share in the pot (exception: if the villian is
    likely to bluff AND our hand is strong enough to call a potential bluff).
 
    * The Dead Money more than compensates for the times we are called and lose.

## Preflop Hand Ranges and Postflop equities

#### *Preflop is not vacuum. Think about equity of a hand before raising preflop.*

Most players lose money-without-showdown. They don't play a well-formulated
preflop game that is cohesive with their overall postflop strategy. There is a 
gap between their preflop and postflop plan. They aren't thinking about equity.

#### **Choose hands that have good postflop equity.**

1. Suited cards: `A2s+`, usually `A2s-A5s` better than `A6s-A9s`.
2. High cards. With a top pair we usually have the best hand. If we miss we
usually have six outs.
3. Connecting cards: `57s`, `67s`.

## Aggression and the Turn

#### *The combination of pot equity and fold equity is mandatory for us to stay aggressive on the turn.*

```
Pot Equity + Fold Equity = Aggression
```

Sometimes pot equity is so high that fold equity isn't important, e.g.:
<b>Q:hearts:J:hearts:</b> on <b>T:hearts:9:hearts:2:clubs:4:diamonds:</b>

The draw is so strong that we need our opponent to fold a very low persentage of
time for a 2nd barrel to be profitable. On the other hand <b>22</b> on
<b>843Ar</b> lacks of pot equity but is compensated by the fact that the
opponent folds high persentage of the time.

If we have <b>A:spades:5:spades:</b> on
<b>9:spades:7:diamonds:3:clubs:T:spades:</b>:
pot equity is good, but the turn card decreases our fold equity, as it hits
the opponent's range.

#### *Continue aggression if the pot equity and fold equity combination is sufficient*

Sometimes it's better to check-raise instead of betting.

1. It's unlikely that the opponent holds a strong hand. 

> <details>
>   <summary>E.g. hero holds <b>A:clubs:5:clubs:</b> on <b>8:clubs:7:clubs:4:hearts:</b>.</summary>
> <p>
> <i>Flop</i>: <b>8:clubs:7:clubs:4:hearts:</b> - Hero bets, opponent calls.
> 
> He usually does not have a powerful hand (<b>88, 77, 44, 65, 87</b>) as he would
> raise these hands.
> Most of his calling range probably includes hands like <b>T9</b>, <b>J9</b>, 
> and <b>A5</b> for
> straight-draws; hands like <b>Q:clubs:T:clubs:</b> or <b>K:clubs:T:clubs:</b>
> for flush-draws, and hands like <b>AJ</b> or <b>KQ</b> that called simply with
> the intention of taking the pot away on the turn. 
> 
> He holds: <i>straight-draws</i>, <i>flush-draws</i>, <i>pair+draws</i>,
> <i>weak pairs</i>, and <i>air</i>.
> 
> </p>
> </details>

2. It's likely that our opponent will bet a wide weak range on the turn. With his
<i>straight-draws</i>, <i>flush-draws</i>, and <i>air</i> he's going to bet the
vast majority of the time. He's likely to check <i>weak pairs</i> and
<i>pair+draws</i> hands behind, as he'll probably wants to get to showdown.

Therefore, if he bets the turn, the vast majority of his range is very weak, and
now the pot is very large. So, this becomes a good time for us to check-raise
the turn as a semibluff, and of course, for reason #3, capitalization of dead
money.

To compensate for tricky moves of our opponent(call with hands like <b>65</b>,
etc)
we need to make sure we have some equity before making this move. Thus,
<b>A:clubs:5:clubs:</b> on board <b>8:clubs:7:clubs:5:hearts:2:diamonds:</b>
is perfect, as we have a ton of equity. <b>A:clubs:J:clubs:</b> would be fine as
well. <b>K:diamonds:Q:hearts:</b> probably wouldn't be a good idea.

#### *Board texture is critical in understanding when to bet and when to check-raise*

If our opponent calls on a wet board, his range generally doesn't include monster
hands like <i>sets</i>, <i>two pairs</i>, and <i>straights</i>. However, if our
opponent calls on a dry board (<b>864r</b>) check-raising the turn gets
significantly
worse. With fewer draws available, a large portion of his turn-betting range now
includes slow-played <i>sets</i>, <i>two pairs</i>, <i>straights</i>

With <b>A:clubs:5:clubs:</b> on <b>8:clubs:6:diamonds:2:hearts:2:clubs:</b>, I'd
almost certainly bet the turn again and plan on folding to a raise as opposed to
check-raising.

#### *What factors affect our fold equity*

1. **Player type.** This is by far the most significant factor in evaluating
the fold equity. Against a bad player our fold equity is greatly reduced.
2. **Board texture.** Overcards increase fold equity, but low cards and 
coordinating cards don’t.
3. **Number of players.** More players - lower fold equity.
4. **Image and Perceived Hand Range.** Tight, solid history - higher; loose,
bluffy history - lower fold equity.

Sometimes these reasons play against each other.

## Bet Sizing and Thin Value

Most people make decision whether or not to call, raise, or fold based on two
main considerations:

1. **Their cards.** Most players won't fold <b>AA</b> on a <b>JT9</b> board when
facing a ton of action because they've got aces - even though they are
relatively unlikely to be ahead.
2. **The board texture.** <b>QQ</b> is likely to get in a lot of money as an
overpair, but shuts down as soon as an <b>A</b> or a <b>K</b> falls.

The size of the bet facing them, in most scenarios, is distant, distant third.

When we're trying to get value bet bigger. We need to choose a bet size that
makes us sure he is still likely to call with worse. This concept is called
thin value.

**Thin Value Betting** means making a bet to be called by worse hands,
accepting that many better hands will also call the bet and understanding that
the value obtained from worse hands will be more than the money lost to better
hands. The "thinner" you bet the smaller your bet size should generally be.

> <i>We hold <b>JJ</b></i> - It's very easy to bet for value.

> <i>We hold <b>AT</b></i> - Some hands that are likely to call our bet are better

> 
> <i>We hold <b>T9</b></i> - There are very few hands that are worse that could
> potentially call a bet (<b>T8, 99, 88</b>). The bet for value ought to be very small,
> e.g. 1/5 of pot.
>

Value betting is the way to beat poker.  The more value we can squeeze out of
hands that are likely ahead, the more money we’re going to make in the long run.
Understanding how to change your value bet sizes depending on the “thinness” of
your bet will help you get the maximum amount of value with your entire range

## Player Identification and Basic Handreading

Player Identification - **Aggressive** or **Passive**:

1. *Stack size*. If someone's sitting with less than a full buy-in at a table,
and they're not a pro-shortstacker, they're usually **passive**.
2. *Limping*. If someone calls a big blind preflop and doesn't open with a
raise, they're **passive**. This usually applies both to preflop and postflop.
3. *Minraising*. This is generally an indicator of a **passive** player who
finally has something worth playing - especially when he minraises postflop.
Additionally, a lot of players will minraise a wide range preflop and then
play passively postflop.
4. *Number of tables*. If someone is sitting at 6 tables with a full stack on
every single one, they're probably **aggressive**. If somebody is sitting on
only one or two tables, and they have limped, minraised, or not kept a full
stack they're usually **passive**.
5. *3-betting*. If somebody sitting on the left has 3-bet you often and
consistently, they're usually **aggressive**. If somebody has 3-bet you only
once or twice, and especially if they've made the 3-bet unusually small or
unusually large, they're usually **passive**.

There are only three types of players:

1) *Passive-bad*. This type of player calls all the time and only raises with
an extremelly strong hand. Value bet them all the time and fold to a raise.
2) *Aggressive-bad*. This type of player still calls all the time, but they
sometimes make raises or bets that are inconsistent with any kind of strong
holding. A great example is the flop donk-bet.
3) *Aggressive-good*. This player plays aggressively, bluffing and value betting
in appropriate spots. They balance their ranges and pose a lot of problems both
preflop and postflop for their opponents.

Both *passive-bad* and *aggressive-bad* tend to make big calls, and thus
bluffing them is, in general, a bad strategy.

**The plan for each type of bad
player is simple - against a *passive-bad* player, we value bet them and we
don't make big calls. Against an *aggressive-bad* player, we value bet them and
we do make big calls.**

## Isolation theory

**Isolation**: To raise preflop in order to play a pot with particular player
or players.

Isolation is predicted on three advantages:

1) Card Advantage;
2) Positional Advantage;
3) Skill Advantage.

<b>
Playing a pot in position against a bad player is worth the risk of playing
OOP with K4s hand, while playing a pot in position with J7s against a bunch of
really good players isn't worth very much at all.
</b>

<b>
We need to be constantly thinking of who we’re intending to play pots against.
</b>

## Table Dynamics

Factors that determine table dynamics:

1) Player types. We need to play tighter or looser depending on opponents on
the left or right. For example, if there is whether an aggresive player or a
shortstacker on the left then we need to play tighter; a big fish on the right -
we play looser.
2) Stack sizes. If there are many shorter stacked players hands like **33** and
**67s** go down in value, as they lose implied odds. On the other side, hands
like **KJ** and **AT** increase in value because they loose reverse implied
odds.
3) Positions. Having a good regular on the left and a fish on the right is
very different than having a good regular on the right and a fish on the left.

*Overall strategy*:
**We want to do whatever we can to keep the fish in the pot.**

Example: <i>Fish limps, a good regular raises on the button. We have <b>QJs</b>
on the blinds. It will be a better decision to call a raise and let the fish to
call also. 3-betting in this case will force a fish to fold and we will be
heads-up with a good regular OOP.</i>
