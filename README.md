## The Reasons for Betting

#### **Each time you're betting - ask yourself: WHY BET?**

There are only two major reasons for betting (and one more):

1. *Value* - betting to get called (or raised) by a worse hand.
2. *Bluff* - betting to get a better hand to fold.
3. *Capitalization of Dead Money (DM)* - making the opponent to fold, whether
his hand better or worse, and collecting money in the pot.

    * Make him fold his equity share in the pot (exception: if the villian is
    likely to bluff AND our hand is string enough to call a potential bluff).
 
    * The Dead Money more than compensate for the times we are called and lose.

## Preflop Hand Ranges and Postflop equities

#### **Preflop is not vacuum. Think about equity of a hand before raising preflop.**

Most players lose money-without-showdown. They don't play a well-formulated
preflop game that is cohesive with their overall postflop strategy. There is a 
gap between their preflop and postflop plan. They aren't thinking about equity.

 <summary>Example: K8o on Button</summary>
<p>
<i>Preflop</i>: Hero raise. BB calls.

<i>Flop</i>: 9 :spades: 7 :diamonds: 3 :clubs: BB checks, Hero bets, BB calls

<i>Turn</i>: 2 :spades: BB checks again.

<b>Now it's complicated.</b>
If we check - we'll inevitably go to showdown with a weak hand and we'll lose
a decent pot. Or we could bet, but the turn card isn't scary and he's unlikely
to fold anything he called on the flop with.

The real problem with the postflop spot starts all the way back preflop. We
choose a hand with poor postflop equity and thus we walk into unprofitable
spots - situations where there is simply nothing we can do right.

#### **Choose hands that have good postflop equity.**

1. Suited cards: A2s+, usually A2s-A5s better than A6s-A9s.
2. High cards. With a top pair we usually have the best hand. If we miss we
usually have six outs.
3. Connecting cards: 57s, 67s.
