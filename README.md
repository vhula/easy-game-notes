## The Reasons for Betting

There are only two major reasons for betting:

1. Value - betting to get called (or raised) by a worse hand.
2. Bluff - betting to get a better hand to fold.

3. Capitalization of Dead Money (DM) - making the opponent to fold, whether his hand better or worse, and collecting money in the pot.

    * Make him fold his equity share in the pot (exception: if the villian is likely to bluff AND our hand is string enough to call a potential bluff).
 
    * The Dead Money more than compensate for the times we are called and lose.
